# Fizz Buzz is a children's word game that teaches division. It's also a classic technical interview question at countless companies. 🐝

# Though this challenge may appear simple to experienced coders,
# it is designed to weed out 90% of job candidates who cannot apply their coding knowledge to a new problem creatively.
# Want to give it a try?

# Create a fizz_buzz.py program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100.

# Here's the catch:

# For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
# For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
# Here's the tricky part: For multiples of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

# Write code below 💖

for i in range(1, 101):

    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("   Fizz Buzz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("   Buzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("   Fizz")
    else:
        print("   ", i)
